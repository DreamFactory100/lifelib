==================================
lifelib v0.9.4 (23 December 2023)
==================================

In this release, most notebooks are updated so that they can be opened and run
on Google Colab. In exchange, links to binder are removed.


To update lifelib, run the following command::

    >>> pip install lifelib --upgrade

If you're using Anaconda, use the ``conda`` command instead::

    >>> conda update lifelib
