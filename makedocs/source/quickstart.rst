Quick Start
===========

.. _getting-lifelib:

Getting lifelib
---------------

If you are on Windows, simply download lifelib with WinPython from :doc:`here <download>`.
Unzip the file. No installation is required. The file
contains a custom Python distribution based on `WinPython`_ distribution,
which includes preinstalled
lifelib, modelx, spyder-modelx and all other relevant packages.

.. _WinPython: https://winpython.github.io/

If you are on Linux or Mac, follow the manual installation instruction below.
If you do not wish to use the WinPython-based distribution, and want to use
lifelib on your `Anaconda`_ environment, follow the instruction.

.. _using-spyder:

Using lifelib with Spyder
-------------------------
`Spyder`_ is a popular scientific Python IDE,
and it's bundled in with WinPython by default.
**Spyder plugin for modelx** adds widgets to Spyder,
which enable you to graphically interface with lifelib models
and to develop, run and analyze the models more efficiently.
Below are the widgets installed by the plugin.

.. _Spyder: https://www.spyder-ide.org/
.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/


Starting Spyder
----------------

To launch Spyder, go to the unzipped folder,
and run *Spyder.exe* by double-clicking it.
If you're using *Anaconda*, you should be able to
launch Spyder from Windows menu.


.. _create-a-project:

Copying a Library
------------------

lifelib is essentially a collection of folders called *libraries*,
which contain models and some other files.
You can create your copy of a library, either from IPython console
or from command prompts.

.. rubric:: Creating a library copy from IPython

You can create a copy of a lifelib library from Spyder's IPython console using
``lifelib.create`` function::

    >>> import lifelib

    >>> lifelib.create("basiclife", "mylife")

The first parameter is the name of the lifelib library to copy.
The second parameter is the folder path to create.
If only a folder name is given, the folder is created under the current
folder.
The *Files* widget in *Spyder* shows where the current folder is.
Alternatively, the current folder can be reported by ``os.getcwd`` function::

    >>> import os

    >>> os.getcwd()

If the second argument is omitted, the first parameter, which is
the library name is used.

.. rubric:: Creating a library from command prompt

Alternatively, you can copy a library
by a command ``lifelib-create`` from the command prompt
named "WinPython Command Prompt.exe" included in the unzipped folder.

For example, to create a project folder named
``mylife`` under the path ``C:\Users\fumito`` by copying lifelib's default
library :py:mod:`~basiclife`,

Go to the unzipped folder and start *WinPython Command Prompt.exe*.
Type the following command on the command prompt::

    > lifelib-create --template basiclife C:\Users\fumito\mylife

Alternatively, since :py:mod:`~basiclife` is the default library,
you can get away with `--template` option like this::

    > lifelib-create C:\Users\fumito\mylife


.. _read-a-model:

Reading a Model
----------------

The created folder contains folders whose names start with *model_*.
Those are model folders. By reading a model folder into an IPython session,
a live *Model* object is created.
For example,
the :doc:`BasicTerm_S</libraries/basiclife/BasicTerm_S>`
model in :mod:`basiclife` is saved as a folder named *BasicTerm_S*.
To read the model,
start an *MxConsole* session by right-clicking on *Console 1/A* tab
and select *New MxConsole*.
Next, right-click on the blank space in MxExplorer
to bring up a context menu.
Select *Read Model* item from the menu.

.. figure:: /images/spyder_plugin/MxExplorerContextMenu.png

   *MxExplorer*'s context menu

Click the folder icon next to the text box at the top,
select the *BasicTerm_S* folder in the created folder then click *OK*.
After model is read successfully, the components of the model
appear as a tree in the MxExplorer.
The top item in the tree is *Projection*, and it represents
the *Projection* Space in the model. The space object contains child objects.
Double-click on *Projection* to expand it and show
*Projection*'s child objects.

.. figure:: /images/spyder_plugin/BasicTermInMxExplorer.png

   *MxExplorer* showing *Projection* and its child objects

Importing Names
----------------

In the *MxConsole*, the model is defined as a variable named
`BasicTerm_S` as you see in the *Variable Explorer* widget,
so typing `BasicTerm_S` in the *MxConsole* returns the model::

    >>> BasicTerm_S
    <Model BasicTerm_S>

*Projection*, and its child objects are not defined in the *MxConsole*,
and they can be retrieved as the attributes of their parents::

    >>> BasicTerm_S.Projection
    <UserSpace BasicTerm_S.Projection>

    >>> BasicTerm_S.Projection.model_point
    <Cells BasicTerm_S.Projection.model_point()>

Auto-completion works in the *MxConsole*, so type the first
couple of characters then hit Tab to complete the remainder.
To access these objects more quickly, you can define variables
that refer to the objects. There is a way to define variables
for a Space and all of its child objects at once.
In *MxExplorer*, select *Projection* in the object tree,
and right-click to show the context menu,
and select *Import Names* from the menu.

The dialog box below shows up. Click *OK*.

.. figure:: /images/spyder_plugin/ImportNames.png

   *Import Names* dialog box

Now, you see the *Projection* space and all the child object in the space
are defined as global variables in the *MxConsole* as you see
in the *Variable Explorer*.

.. figure:: /images/spyder_plugin/VariableExplorer.png

   *Variable Explorer* showing defined global variables


Calculating Values
------------------

Most of the child objects are *Cells* object.
A Cells acts like a function, but instead of always calculating
the value for the same arguments, it calculates
the value for the same arguments only once,
and keep the returned value until the Cells needs to be refreshed.
The calculation logic of a Cells is defined by a Python function
as a *Formula* object.
To calculate the value of a Cells for certain arguments,
simply call the Cells with the arguments::

    >>> claims(0)
    34.18079328868595

In the *BasicTerm_S* model, the ``result_cf`` Cells returns the projected
cashflow result of a selected model point
as a DataFrame object. It does not take any arguments::

    >>> result_cf()
          Premiums     Claims    Expenses  Commissions  Net Cashflow
    0    94.840000  34.180793  300.000000    94.840000   -334.180793
    1    94.005734  33.880120    4.956017    94.005734    -38.836137
    2    93.178806  33.582091    4.912421    93.178806    -38.494512
    3    92.359153  33.286684    4.869209    92.359153    -38.155893
    4    91.546710  32.993876    4.826377    91.546710    -37.820252
    ..         ...        ...         ...          ...           ...
    116  62.432465  63.534771    3.599824     0.000000     -4.702130
    117  62.317757  63.418038    3.593210     0.000000     -4.693491
    118  62.203260  63.301519    3.586608     0.000000     -4.684868
    119  62.088973  63.185215    3.580019     0.000000     -4.676260
    120   0.000000   0.000000    0.000000     0.000000      0.000000

    [121 rows x 5 columns]

The ``result_pv`` Cells returns a DataFrame that shows
the present values of the cashflows
and their percentages to the present value of premiums::

    >>> result_pv()
                  Premiums       Claims    Expenses  Commissions  Net Cashflow
    PV         8251.931435  5501.074678  748.303591  1084.601434    917.951731
    % Premium     1.000000     0.666641    0.090682     0.131436      0.111241


Viewing Values
---------------

The *MxDataViewer* widget
is useful for viewing values contained in Cells and Reference
objects, especially when they hold vector or tabular data,
such as pandas Series, DataFrames and numpy arrays.

For example, to view the values of ``result_cf``,
double-click on ``result_cf`` in *MxExplorer* to show
*BasicTerm_S.Projection.result_cf* at the top of *MxDataViewer*,
then click *Update*.

.. figure:: /images/spyder_plugin/result_cf_InMxDataViewer.png

   *MxDataViewer* showing ``result_cf``

Tracing Calculations
---------------------

The *MxAnalyzer* widget
is useful for tracing values and formulas used for calculating
a value of a specific Cells.

For example, to trace the calculations of ``result_cf``,
select ``result_cf`` in *MxExplorer* and right-click to bring up
the context menu, then from the menu select *Analyzer Selected*.

.. _running-notebooks:

Running Notebooks
-----------------

Running Notebooks online
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jupyter Notebook enables you to run Python code in your browser.
lifelib comes with some Jupyter notebooks, and the quickest way
to try lifelib is to run the notebooks online.
Go to :doc:`notebooks` page and click one of the banner links.
The link will take you to a web page where the selected notebook starts loading.
Once the notebook loads, select **Cell** menu,
and then select **Run All** to run & build models and get results and draw graphs.

Running Notebooks locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jupyter notebooks on :doc:`notebooks` page are also included in lifelib
projects, and can be executed on your local computer by running
Jupyter Notebook locally.
For example, if you create a project folder named ``myifrs17sim`` from
the project template :py:mod:`ifrs17sim<ifrs17sim>`,
you can go to the folder by ``cd`` command and launch Jupyter Notebook::

    > cd myifrs17sim

    > jupyter notebook

The command above opens a new tab in your web browser,
and Jupyter Notebook session starts in the tab.

.. figure:: /images/notebook/myifrs17sim-files.png

files with ``ipynb`` extension are Jupyter notebooks. By double-clicking one,
it opens in another tab, and you'll see the same page as you see it online.
