Manual Installation
===================

This section explains how to manually install liflib into an existing Python environment.
If you get lifelib with WinPython from the download page,
lifelib and all the relevant packages are pre-installed and pre-configured,
so no need to follow the steps on this page.

Requirements
-------------

lifelib is cross-platform, and supports Windows, Linux and Mac.
This guide shows installation steps based on Windows,
the steps are the same on other platforms, except that *command prompt*
should be interpreted as *terminal* on Linux and Mac.

lifelib works with Python 3.6 or newer.
However, Python 3.6 reached its `end of life <https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches>`_
so if you're still using Python 3.6, you should upgrade it.
The newer the version of Python is, the faster it performs.

Microsoft Excel is not required. You would only need Excel or its alternatives
if you want to edit input data files.

Install lifelib
---------------

.. rubric:: Anaconda environment

`Anaconda`_ is a bundle of Python, its major packages and IDEs including
packages required or optionally used by lifelib,
such as `numpy`_, `pandas`_, `Spyder`_, and provides a Python environment
out-of-the-box, just by installing it with few clicks.

If your Python environment is based on `Anaconda`_,
you should use the ``conda`` command
to download lifelib from `conda-forge`_ and install it into the environment.

Go to Windows menu and
start *Anaconda Prompt* inside *Anaconda3* submenu to bring up a command prompt.

.. figure:: /images/AnacondaPrompt.png

Then in the *Anaconda Prompt*, execute the following command::

    > conda install -c conda-forge lifelib

The command above also installs `modelx`_ automatically, which lifelib depends on.
You may also need to install `openpyxl`_ manually, if not installed yet.
To check if it's installed, type::

    > conda list

and see if `openpyxl`_ is listed in the output. If not listed, type::

    > conda install openpyxl

to install `openpyxl`_. In case your environment is missing `numpy`_ or `pandas`_ by any chance,
install them in the same way.

.. rubric:: Non-Anaconda environment

lifelib is available on `PyPI`_ - the Python Package Index.
If your Python environment is not `Anaconda`_, use ``pip`` command to download and install lifelib.
In the case of the custom WinPython downloaded from this site's download page,
open *WinPython Command Prompt*. From the command prompt, type::

    > pip install lifelib

The command above also installs `modelx`_ automatically, which lifelib depends on.
You may also need to install `openpyxl`_ manually, if not installed yet.
To check if it's installed, type::

    > pip list

and see if `openpyxl`_ is listed in the output. If not listed, type::

    > pip install openpyxl

to install `openpyxl`_. In case your environment is missing `numpy`_ or `pandas`_ by any chance,
install them in the same way.

.. Note::
   *(For advanced users)* To install the latest development version instead of
   the released version,
   clone the `lifelib repository`_ and `modelx repository`_ on github,
   and install them from the cloned repos in `editable mode`_.


Update lifelib
---------------

.. rubric:: Anaconda environment

In the case of an Anaconda environment,
to update lifelib to the newest release, type from *Anaconda prompt*::

    > conda update lifelib

.. rubric:: Non-Anaconda environment

In the case of a non-Anaconda environment, including the WinPython from the download page,
to update your existing installation to the newest release, use ``-U`` option with ``pip``::

    > pip install -U lifelib

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/lifelib/
.. _lifelib repository: https://github.com/lifelib-dev/lifelib
.. _modelx repository: https://github.com/fumitoh/modelx
.. _editable mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs
.. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/


Install Spyder plugin for modelx
--------------------------------

`Spyder`_ is a popular open-source Python IDE,
and it allows plugins to be installed to add extra features to itself.
:doc:`Spyder plugin for modelx </quickstart/spyder>` enriches user interface to modelx in Spyder.
The plugin adds custom IPython consoles and GUI widgets for using modelx in Spyder.

.. rubric:: Anaconda environment

Spyder is bundled in with `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ by default.
To install the plugin for modelx, type the following command in *WinPython Command Prompt*::

    > conda install -c conda-forge spyder-modelx

The command above installs ``spyder-modelx`` and ``spymx-kernels``. Both packages are required
for the plugin.

To launch Spyder, go to Windows menu, select Spyder inside *Anaconda3* menu.

.. figure:: /images/SpyderMenu.png

.. rubric:: Non-Anaconda environment

Spyder plugin for modelx is available on PyPI as a separate Python package.
To install the plugin into a non-Anaconda environment, type by the following command::

    > pip install spyder-modelx

The command above installs `spyder-modelx` and `spymx-kernels`. Both packages are required
for the plugin for modelx.

For more about Spyder plugin for modelx, refer to `Spyder plugin`_ page
on modelx documentation site.

.. Note::
    lifelib models are built in the form of `modelx`_ objects.
    Refer to `modelx`_ documentation when you have
    questions about `modelx`_ as you proceed with this guide.
    To learn Python itself, there are many good tutorials out there on the web,
    such as
    `the one on Python's official web site <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_.

Configure Spyder
----------------

There are 2 Spyder settings that you want to consider changing from their
default values.
Note that you need to restart Spyder to bring your changes into effect.

**Disable User Module Reloader**

Reloading modelx module creates multiple instances of modelx systems within
the same Python process,
causing models created before and after a reload to reside in different
modelx systems. To prevent this, you need to change *User Module Reloader (UMR)*
setting.

From the Spyder menu, select *Tools->Preferences* to bring up Preferences window.
Choose *Python interpreter* in the left pane, and you'll find an area titled
*User Module Reloader (UMR)* on the bottom right side of the Preferences window.
Leave *Enable UMR* option checked,
click *Set UMR excluded(not reloaded) modules* and then UMR dialog box pops up
as the figure blow.
Enter "modelx" in the dialog box. This prevents
Spyder from reloading the modelx module every time you re-run the same script
from *Run* menu, while allowing other modules to be reloaded.

**Graphic Backend**

By defult, *Graphic Backend* option is set to *Inline*. This option affects
where graphs are placed, and how modelx GUI widgets behaves.

If *Graphic Backend* is set to *Inline*, graphs are embedded in the IPython
console as an output. If it is set to *Automatic*, graphs are drawn
in separate windows, which pop up upon calling plot methods on matplotlib objects.

If you're fine with the default *Inline* mode, then no need to change anything.
To change *Graphic Backend* option, go to *Tools->Preferences*, and on the
left side of the Preferences window, select *IPython console* then
*Graphics* tab on the right pane.
